# Article 30 - Development Review Procedures

## 30.1 General

### A. Authority to File Applications
Applications for development approval under these Zoning Regulations may be filed by: the property owner of record, a purchaser under a contract for sale from the record owner, or the duly authorized agent of the record property owner. County officials shall be authorized to require proof of legal authority to take the action sought.

### B. Form of Application
Applications required under this Article must be submitted on forms and in such numbers as required by the official responsible for accepting the application.

### C. Fees

**1. Application Filing Fees**
Applications must be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee established by County Commission. Fees shall not be required with applications initiated by Review and or Decision-Making Bodies. See [Article 160](Article_160_Fee_Schedule.md).

**2. Special Hearing Deposit**

a. Generally
Where the total time of a hearing is expected to exceed 2 hours, as determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, a special hearing expense deposit shall be paid by the applicant in addition to the application filing fee. Special hearing deposits are to cover actual expenses. The required deposit amounts have been established by County Commission. At any point prior to the conclusion of all hearings on a matter, the County Commission may, for good cause and based on anticipated actual costs, require a deposit to exceed the amount required for applications falling in the "Other" category of "Special Hearing Deposit," as shown in the Fee Schedule of [Article 160](Article_160_Fee_Schedule.md).

b. Application Review
At the time of application filing, the applicant shall state the number of witnesses and the amount of time the applicant anticipates for the presentation of all evidence to applicable review and decision-making bodies. The application must be accompanied by a list of witnesses and exhibits. The Planning and Zoning Administrator will review all applications and make a determination of whether the hearing is likely to exceed 2 hours in length. Such determination shall be based upon: 

   (1) the information supplied in the application, 
   (2) the expected amount of public input, and 
   (3) the Planning and Zoning Administrator's experience with local practices. 

If it is determined by the Planning and Zoning Administrator that the public hearing will exceed 2 hours in length, the applicant shall be subject to the special hearing deposit provisions of this Sub-Article.

c. Deposit Required
If at any time either before the filing of the application, or prior to a final decision of the applicable decision-making body, the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines that the hearings are likely to exceed 2 hours in length, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall notify the applicant in writing of this determination and order the applicant to post a special hearing expense deposit, which shall be held in an account by the County Treasurer in a depository established for that purpose by the County Commission. Upon the issuance of such order by the Planning and Zoning Administrator, all proceedings upon the application shall be stayed until the deposit is received by the county. After such a stay is in effect for a period of 14 calendar days and the deposit is not made with the county, the application shall be dismissed, without prejudice against re-filing of the application.

d. Escrow Account Established
There shall be an escrow account established under the supervision of the County Treasurer's Office for each case for which the applicant pays an expense deposit. The County Treasurer shall disburse payment from the escrow account upon billings supplied by the Planning and Zoning Administrator and approved by the County Commission. These billings shall reflect the actual charges incurred which will be charged against the amount on deposit in escrow. When each billing is made, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall simultaneously mail a copy of the billing to the applicant at the address listed in the application.

e. Additional Deposits
At any time that the escrow account falls below a balance of 20 percent of the initial total expense deposit, the County Treasurer shall immediately inform the Planning and Zoning Administrator, whereupon the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall write to the applicant at the address shown on the application and direct the applicant to make deposit equal to the amount of the initial expense deposit. After the Planning and Zoning Administrator make such order, all proceedings on the application shall be stayed until the county receives the additional deposit. If the additional deposit is not received within 14 calendar days of said order, or if the applicant indicates a refusal to make such additional deposit, the application shall be dismissed without prejudice against re-filing.

f. Refunds
Upon final disposition of the application or dismissal of the application, the balance of the deposit in escrow with the County Treasurer, after all expense payments are made, shall be returned to the applicant upon the applicant's written request.

### D. Complete Application
Applications that do not include required information or that are not accompanied by required fees will be returned to the applicant and no further processing of the application will occur until the deficiencies are corrected. Applications will be reviewed for completeness within 10 days of filing. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is complete, the application will be processed. If the official responsible for accepting the application determines that the application is incomplete, the application will be returned to the applicant along with a written explanation of the application's deficiencies.

### E. Preapplication Conferences
All applicants are encouraged to schedule and attend a preapplication conference meeting with Planning and Zoning Department staff prior to submitting an application for review under this Article. The purpose of a preapplication conference is to inform the applicant of applicable procedures, submittal requirements, development standards, and other pertinent matters before the applicant finalizes the development proposal. Staff opinions presented during a preapplication meeting are informational only and do not represent a commitment on behalf of the county regarding the acceptability of the development proposal.

### F. Establishment of Processing Cycles
Officials responsible for accepting applications, after consulting with review and decision-making bodies, may promulgate processing cycles for applications. Processing cycles may establish:

1. Deadlines for receipt of complete applications;
2. Dates of regular meetings;
3. The scheduling of staff reviews and staff reports on complete applications;
4. All required steps in the application process (including public hearings, and reviews by other agencies); and
5. Required time frames for action by review and decision-making bodies.

### G. Planning and Zoning Administrator and Agency Review
In conducting required reviews, the Planning and Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to distribute the application and other submittals to other departments and agencies for the purpose of soliciting comments and ensuring that the proposal complies with all applicable standards and requirements. The Technical Review Committee (TRC) may be convened to review technical aspects of applications. See [Article 20.4C](Article_20_Review_Decision_Making_Bodies.md#b-technical-review-committee).

### H. Notices
All notices required under these Zoning Regulations must: 

(1) indicate the time and place of all scheduled public hearings; 
(2) describe the property involved in the application by street address, legal description or map; 
(3) describe the nature, scope and purpose of the proposal; and 
(4) indicate the location and source of additional information about the proposal.

**1. Written Notice**

a. Unless otherwise expressly stated, when the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that written notice be provided, the official responsible for accepting the application shall provide written notice by regular mail to all owners of the subject property and all property owners within 600 feet of the subject property. ([RSMo 64.863](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.863)) Written notice shall also be sent by regular mail to the City Clerk of any municipality within 1½ miles of the subject property. ([RSMo 64.830](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.830), [64.860](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.860))

b. Written notices shall be deposited in the U.S. mail at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing.

c. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the Planning and Zoning Department with a list of the names and addresses of the owners of record of all property within 600 feet of the subject property. The ownership information shall be obtained from a licensed abstractor, title company, registered surveyor or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant. This information should be provided in electronic and printed form. Failure to notify all adjoiners may invalidate the public notice requirements and cause the application to be tabled until proper notification is completed.

**2. Published Notice**
When the provisions of these Zoning Regulations require that notice be published in the newspaper, the official responsible for accepting the application shall ensure that notice is published in a newspaper of general circulation within Ray County at least 15 days before the first scheduled public hearing.

**3. Constructive Notice**
Minor technical deviations from specified notice requirements shall not be deemed to impair notice where there is actual notice. Written notice shall be conclusively presumed to be properly given if placed, postage prepaid, with the United States Postal Service addressed in accordance with the list provided by the applicant. When required written notices have been properly given, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action. In all cases, however, the requirements for the timing of the notice and for specifying the time, date and place of a hearing and the general location of the subject property shall be strictly construed. If questions arise at the hearing regarding the adequacy of notice, the body hearing the matter shall determine whether there was compliance with the notice requirements of this Article.

**4. Delay in County Commission Hearing**
If there is a delay in forwarding a recommendation to the County Commission based on technical reasons, and no specific date is announced at the Planning and Zoning Commission public hearing, written notice shall be sent by regular mail to all adjoiners within 600 feet at least 15 days prior to the County Commission hearing at which the application will be heard.

### I. Action by Review and Decision-Making Bodies

1. Review and decision-making bodies may take any action on an application that is consistent with the notice given, including approving the application, approving the application in modified form or denying the application. Decision-making bodies shall also be authorized to remand an application back to a review body for further consideration and recommendation.

2. Review bodies may recommend and decision-making bodies may modify or allow amendments to the application if the effect of the modifications or amendments is to allow a less intensive use or zoning district than indicated in the application or to reduce the impact of the development or to reduce the amount of land area included in the application. (See [Zoning District Hierarchy, Article 40.1](Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#402-zoning-district-hierarchy))

3. Decision-making bodies may not approve an application for a greater density of development, a more intensive use, a more intensive zoning district, reduced setbacks, more dwelling units, greater height, more access points or fewer improvements than indicated in the notice.

### G. Protest Petitions

**1. Majority Vote Required**
If a valid protest petition is submitted to County Clerk within 14 days of the date of the conclusion of the Planning and Zoning Commission's last hearing on the proposed Zoning District Map amendment, approval of the Zoning District Map amendment by the County Commission shall require a favorable vote of at least 2/3 of all the members of the County Commission. If the County Commission returns the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission for reconsideration, previously filed petitions shall be invalidated and a new protest petition must be filed.

**2. Definition of "Valid" Protest Petition**
a. In order to be deemed "valid," a protest petition must be:

   (1) Signed and acknowledged by the owners of 30 percent of the frontage within 1000 feet to the right or left of the frontage proposed to be changed;
   
   (2) Signed and acknowledged by the owners of 30 percent of the frontage directly opposite, or directly in the rear of the frontage proposed to be altered; or
   
   (3) Made by resolution of the city council or board of trustees of a zoned municipality located within 1½ miles of the subject tract. ([RSMo 64.875](https://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.875))

b. The term "owner" for purposes of protest petitions shall include all those individuals that have ownership in the subject real property or property within 1,000 feet as provided in this Article. If the property is owned by joint tenancy, all such owners must sign the petition by their own hand to be valid, unless the petition itself clearly indicates that one tenant has the legal authority to sign for and on behalf of the other. If a corporation, partnership or entity other than an individual meets the requirements to protest an action and desires to sign a petition; the following must appear on the petition in order for such organization to be counted with the petition:

   (1) The proper name in which title to its property is held;
   
   (2) The address of its property;
   
   (3) The name of the individual signing on behalf of the corporation, partnership or entity;

If the County Commission denies an application for a Zoning District Map Amendment, an application for the same or more intensive zoning on the subject parcel, whether the parcel is in its original configuration or expanded or reduced in area, shall not be accepted for 6 months from the date that the County Commission acted to deny the amendment.

2. If the County Commission denies an application for a Zoning District Map Amendment, for [I-1](Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#4013-i-1-limited-industrial-district) or [I-2](Article_40_Base_Zoning_Districts.md#4014-i-2-general-industrial-district) zoning, an application for the same or more intensive zoning district shall not be accepted for 3 years from the date that the County Commission acted to deny the amendment.

### I. Appeals
