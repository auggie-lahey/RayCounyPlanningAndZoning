30.8  Planned Unit Developments


A Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a type of overlay zoning district and a type of
development plan that primarily address the issues of mixed-use development.  PUD zoning districts are inextricably linked to PUD plans in that no rights of development apply to a PUD zoning designation other than those of the approved PUD plan.


A.        Overview of Procedure 
PUDs shall be processed in 5 stages: Preapplication Conference; Concept Plan; Rezoning to PUD district, Final Plan, and Final Plat.  Concept Plans and Rezoning may be processed concurrently, provided that no rezoning to the PUD district may occur until approval of a PUD Concept Plan.


        1.        Preapplication Conference
Before submitting a PUD Concept Plan, the applicant shall confer with the Planning and Zoning Administrator or other officials designated by the Administrator such as Missouri Department of Conservation, Soil & Water Conservation District or other such agencies.  The purpose of this preapplication conference is to discuss the proposal and the applicable development review procedures.
        2.        Application
A complete application for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission.  No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. 


        3.        PUD Concept Plan
A PUD Concept Plan is a generalized land use plan for the entire area proposed to be included within a PUD. The purpose of a PUD Concept Plan is to allow early review of a proposed PUD before substantial technical planning work has been undertaken. 


                a.   The PUD Concept Plan is not intended to be a highly detailed site plan, but rather to
provide enough information to officials to allow an accurate determination of the merits of a proposed project prior to beginning detailed planning work. Much of the information required at the Concept Plan stage can be conveyed in written form, although some generalized drawings will likely be required to comply with the following list of required information. (Figure 30.8-1)


                b.        The PUD Concept Plan is reviewed with respect to such issues as density, including the number, type, and location of dwelling units and other uses; impacts on surrounding areas; and the adequacy of facilities and services.  The result of this review is the establishment of the basic parameters for development of the PUD.  PUD Concept Plan approval establishes the maximum development “envelope” with regard to density, lot sizes, overall scale, open space, environmental protection, and other land development and service provision issues.


    Figure 30.8-1

                        Written and Published notice of the Planning and Zoning Commission’s public hearing shall be provided in accordance with Article 30.1H-1 and Article 30.1H-2.


                d.        Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator
                        The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Concept Plan application in light of the PUD zoning standards of Article 80 and all other applicable development standards and planning policies. The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall provide a copy of the report to the Planning and Zoning Commission and the applicant.


                e.        Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
                        The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Concept Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Concept Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.


                f.        Review and Action—County Commission
                        After receiving the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, the County Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the proposed PUD Concept Plan. If the County Commission acts to approve the PUD Concept Plan, it shall establish required time frames for development of the entire PUD and its individual phases, if any.




                g.        PUD Concept Plan Review Criteria
Applications for PUD Concept Plan approval shall be approved if the County Commission determines that the following criteria are met:


1)        The PUD Concept Plan complies with the PUD standards of Figure 30.8-1;


2)        The county and other agencies will be able to provide necessary public services, facilities, and programs to serve the development proposed, at the time the property is developed;


3)        The development is consistent with and implements the planning goals and 
        objectives contained in Comprehensive Plan and other adopted policy
        documents;


                        4)        The PUD Concept Plan is consistent with sound planning practice and the development will promote the general welfare of the county; and
 
5)        A PUD is necessary to address a unique situation or represents a substantial
        benefit to the county, compared to what could have been accomplished through
        strict application of otherwise applicable base zoning district standards; and


6.  The same development could not be accomplished through the use of other   
        techniques, such as rezoning to a non-PUD district or Variances.


                h.        Effect of PUD Concept Plan Approval
                        Approval of a PUD Concept Plan shall constitute acceptance of the overall planning concepts for the proposed PUD development and is a prerequisite for the filing of a PUD Final Plan and approval of a PUD zoning classification.


                i.        Lapse of PUD Concept Plan Approval
                        An approved PUD Concept Plan shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a PUD Final Plan for the PUD (or a phase of the PUD) has not been approved within 2 years of the date of approval by the County Commission of the PUD Concept Plan. In the event of such lapse, the PUD zoning classification shall be of no effect, and the property shall be developed solely in accordance with the underlying zoning classification.  In the event of lapse of approval pursuant to this Article, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall initiate action to remove the land from the PUD overlay zoning district and may initiate action to rezone the property to its former base zoning district classification.


        4.        PUD Zoning District Map Amendment
                After approval of a PUD Concept Plan, or concurrently with the processing of a PUD Concept Plan, a Zoning District Map amendment request for PUD zoning may be reviewed and approved. PUD zoning requests shall be processed in accordance with the Zoning District Map amendment procedures of Article 30.3.


        5.        PUD Final Plan
                The PUD Final Plan is the document upon which building permits and other applicable approvals are issued.  The PUD Final Plan review stage is the point at which developers bring forward detailed plans for carrying out the type of project conceptually approved during PUD Concept Plan review.  The applicant must submit the detailed and technical information necessary to demonstrate that all applicable standards, requirements, and conditions have been met. 


                a.        Application
                        After approval of a PUD zoning classification and before lapse of a PUD Concept Plan, a complete application for PUD Final Plan approval must be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Administrator in a form established by the Planning and Zoning Administrator along with a nonrefundable fee that has been established by the County Commission. No application shall be processed until the application is complete and the required fee has been paid. A PUD Final Plan application may include the entire area covered in the PUD Concept Plan or it may include one or more phases of the approved PUD Concept Plan. The final PUD plan shall include the same information as required with a Preliminary Subdivision Plat (see Figure 30.6-1).


                b.        Review and Report—Planning and Zoning Administrator
                        The Planning and Zoning Administrator shall prepare a staff report that reviews the PUD Final Plan application in light of the approved PUD Concept Plan and all other applicable development standards and planning policies.


                c.        Review and Recommendation—Planning and Zoning Commission
                        The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the PUD Final Plan. At the close of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the PUD Final Plan application and transmit a written summary of its action and proceedings to the County Commission.        


                d.        Review and Action—County Commission
                        The County Commission shall consider the PUD Final Plan application and act to approve or deny the PUD Final Plan application. 


                e.        PUD Final Plan Review Criteria
                        A PUD Final Plan shall be approved by the County Commission if it is determined by the County Commission to be in substantial compliance with the approved PUD Concept Plan.  The PUD Final Plan shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the PUD Concept Plan so long as, when compared with the PUD Concept Plan, it does not result in:


 1)         An increase in project density or intensity, including the number of housing
                 units per acre or the amount of nonresidential floor area per acre;


 2)         A change in the mix of housing types or the amount of land area devoted to
         nonresidential uses;


 3)         A reduction in the amount of open space;
         4)         Any change to the vehicular system which results in a significant change in the amount or location of streets, parking areas, or access to the PUD;


 5)         Any change within 50 feet of any residential zoning district;


         6)         Any change determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission to         
                 represent an increase in development intensity; or


 7).         A substantial change in the layout of buildings.


        6.        Final Plats
To complete the platting process, the applicant need only to submit and record a Final Plat for the phase(s) under development in accordance with Figure 30.6-2.  


a.  The PUD Final Plan and the Final Plat for the first phase(s) may be reviewed 
     concurrently, at the option of the applicant.


b.  A note shall be included on the Final Plat stating:
          [Example:] “Rezoned to Residential (R-1, R-3) Zoning District with a Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlay.” 


                 c.  A Final Plat shall be recorded for each phase of the plan after the infrastructure to be built by the developer has been constructed and approved, or adequate bonding or letter of credit submitted to the County.


30.9  Conditional Use Permits
The purpose of a Conditional Use Permit is to allow for acceptable uses in the Zoning Regulations; however, additional review and conditions are necessary for permitting the use.  The use is restricted to the individual applicant and is not transferable to another.  The County Commission may make specific requirements that are not explicitly detailed in the Zoning Regulations, as deemed necessary for the activity to be conducted on a given parcel of land.  Conditional Use Permits are not transferable to another person or parcel of land.


A.        Application Filing
        Conditional Use Permit applications shall be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Department on forms available in the Planning and Zoning Department.

A property abstractor, title company, registered surveyor, or similarly qualified person whose services have been secured by the applicant shall have originated such list.


2. Water Supply Approval        
        Written approval from the respective public water supply district (PWSD) or a municipal water supplier for the proposed project shall be submitted with the application. If water service from the PWSD is not available, this should be noted in 
                writing from the district.  If the project is not within the boundaries of any PWSD, and not capable to be served by any other water supplier, arrangements shall be made in accordance with this Article.


3. Sanitary Sewer Approval
                In some instances, written approval must be submitted at the time of application from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR). If sanitary sewer service is to be provided from a sewer district or private sewer company, written approval of such service shall be provided from the service provider with the preliminary plat application.

        a.        If the County Commission denies an application for a Conditional Use Permit, an application for the same or more intensive use shall not be accepted for 6 months from the date that the County Commission acted to deny the amendment.


                b.        If the County Commission denies a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in the I-1 or I-2 zoning districts, an application for the same or more intensive use on the subject parcel, whether the parcel is in its original configuration or expanded or reduced in area, shall not be accepted for 5 years from the date of the County Commission’s action to deny the Conditional Use Permit.


1)        The Planning and Zoning Administrator may permit a re-filing of a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning after 6 months if the Planning and Zoning Administrator determines, based on clear and convincing evidence provided by the applicant, that a substantial change in circumstances has occurred since the County Commission denied the rezoning which is the result of new facts that were not discoverable by the applicant during the previous proceedings with the use of reasonable diligence or as a result of material facts which have arisen since the previous decision. Such showings must be made prior to acceptance of the application.


2)        The decision of the Planning and Zoning Administrator on a request to re-file a Conditional Use Permit for a use first allowed in I-1 or I-2 zoning must be provided in writing and forwarded to the applicant with a copy of the decision to the Planning and Zoning Commission within 30 days of the submission of an application.

30.10  Sign Permits
This Article sets out the procedures for review and approval of Sign Plans and Sign Permits for signs requiring permits under Article 120.




A.        Sign Plans
          
        1.        Applicability
Sign Plan approval shall be required for any site containing or proposed to contain more than 1 sign. No Sign Permit shall be issued for a site that is subject to Sign Plan requirements until a Sign Plan has been approved. Temporary signs shall be exempt from sign plan requirements.






        2.        Application Filing
Sign Plan applications shall be submitted to the Building Official on forms available from the Building Official.  In addition, a graphic shall be submitted that will give the location of the proposed sign(s) on the property measured in feet, accurate dimensions of the proposed sign(s), type of construction proposed, lighting, language to appear on the sign, logos, and other information to illustrate the proposed sign.




3.        Staff Review and Action
The Building Official shall review each proposed sign application in accordance with the Sign Plan review criteria set forth in Article 30.9A and act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the Sign Plan.


4.        Sign Plan Approval Criteria
A Sign Plan may be approved only if the Building Official determines that all of the following approval criteria have been met:


1. the Sign Plan complies with all applicable standards of this Land Development  
      Code, including the sign regulations of Article 120; 
                
b.        the Sign Plan is consistent with any approved or concurrently proposed PUD, subdivision or site plan for the site.


.


B.        Individual Sign Permits


        1.        Applicability
Signs identified with a “P” in Table 120-1 shall be erected, installed or created only in accordance with a duly issued and valid sign permit. Sign permits shall be required for new signs, new sign structures and prior to changing the sign face on an existing sign structure.
        
        2.        Application Filing
Sign Permit applications shall be submitted to the Building Official on forms available from the Building Official.


        3.        Staff Review and Action
The Building Official shall review each proposed Sign Permit application for the purpose of determining whether the proposed sign complies with all applicable sign regulations of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable. Based on that review, the Building Official shall:


                a.        Issue the Sign Permit, if the sign complies in every respect with the standards of Article 120 and the Sign Plan, if applicable; or


                b.        Deny the sign permit if the sign fails in any way to comply with the standards of Article 120 or the applicable Sign Plan.


        3.        Lapse of Approval/Inspections        
If an approved sign has not been erected or otherwise put in place within 6 months of the issuance of the Sign Permit, the Sign Permit shall lapse and be of no further effect. The applicant shall request that the Building Official inspect the sign at the end or following the end of the 6-month period following issuance of the Sign Permit. If, upon inspection, the construction is substantially incomplete, the Building Official shall give the property owner or tenant notice that the Sign Permit has lapsed. If, upon inspection, the construction is found to be substantially complete but not in full compliance with Article 120 or other applicable codes, the Building Official shall give the property owner or tenant notice of the deficiencies and shall allow an additional 30 days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by such date, the Sign Permit shall lapse and the sign shall be removed immediately. The failure to remove sign for which permits have lapsed shall be unlawful.

D.        Approval Criteria


        1.    Use Variances
A Variance that would have the effect of allowing a use that the underlying zoning district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment if the Board of Zoning Adjustment determines that all of the following conditions have been met:


                a.        the requested Variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;


                b.        the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;


                c.        the strict application of the provisions of which the Variance is requested will constitute a practical difficulty because the property cannot be used for an otherwise permitted use without coming into conflict with applicable site development standards; and 




                d.        the Variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare, nor destroy the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.
                


        2.        Non-Use Variances
A Variance that does not have the effect of allowing a use that the underlying zoning district prohibits may be granted by the Board of Zoning Adjustment if the Board of Zoning Adjustment determines that all of the following conditions have been met:


                a.        the requested Variance arises from conditions that are unique to the subject property, that are not ordinarily found in the same zoning district and that are not a result of the owner's intentional action;


                b.        the granting of the permit for the Variance will not be contrary to the public interest and will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;


                c.   the strict application of the provisions of which a Variance is requested will constitute an unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application; and


                d.        the Variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or general welfare, nor destroy the intent of the Comprehensive Plan.


        3.        Conditions of Approval
In acting to approve a Variance, the Board of Zoning Adjustment may impose conditions deemed necessary to eliminate or minimize any potential adverse impact upon other property in the area, or to carry out the general purpose and intent of these Zoning Regulations, so long as the condition relates to a situation created or aggravated by the proposed use and is roughly proportional to its impact. Such conditions may include site design requirements and time limitations on the Variance.


        4.    Appeals
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Adjustment on a Variance application may present to the Circuit Court of Ray County a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.
